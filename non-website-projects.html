        <h3>Database Projects</h3>
        <p>I was brought into a department in North Shore Waitemata Distict Health Board called Clinical Records as general contractpr. Given my software development background, they wanted me to build multiple databases that they can manage in house. The application that I used to create the following databases is Microsoft Access 2010. I wrote code in VBA and SQL in the backend.</p>
        <p>I built a total of 6 databases for them. Through this databases they are able to enter in their job details easily as supposed to putting it in an Excel Spreadsheet. They are also able to generate reports with just a click of button. Moreover, multiple users are able to use the databases at the same time which helps with their productivity through out the day.</p>
